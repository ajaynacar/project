      </section>
      <div class="column">
        
        <p><span class="custom-heading">Python</span>: Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It emphasizes code readability and offers a large standard library, making it popular for tasks ranging from web development to scientific computing.</p>
        <p><span class="custom-heading">JavaScript</span>: JavaScript is a versatile scripting language primarily used for creating dynamic web content and web applications. It runs on the client side of the web, enabling interactivity and dynamic behavior.</p>
        <p><span class="custom-heading">Java</span>: Java is a widely-used, general-purpose programming language that is designed to be platform-independent. It is known for its "write once, run anywhere" principle, making it suitable for developing applications for various platforms and devices.</p>
       <p><span class="custom-heading">PHP</span>: PHP is a server-side scripting language primarily used for web development. It is embedded within HTML code and is often used to create dynamic web pages or build web applications.
       </p>
        <p><span class="custom-heading">Go</span>: Go, also known as Golang, is a statically-typed programming language developed by Google. It is designed for simplicity, efficiency, and concurrency, making it suitable for building scalable networked and distributed systems.
        </p>
        <p><span class="custom-heading">C++</span>: C++ is an extension of the C programming language that adds object-oriented programming features. It is widely used in game development, system software, and other performance-critical applications that require both efficiency and high-level abstractions.</p>
        <p><span class="custom-heading">C</span>: C is a low-level programming language that is efficient and powerful. It provides direct access to system-level resources and is often used for developing operating systems, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.
        </p>
        <p><span class="custom-heading">C#</span>: C# (pronounced "C sharp") is a modern, general-purpose programming language developed by Microsoft. It is often used for Windows desktop applications, game development with Unity, and backend development with the .NET framework.</p>
        <p><span class="custom-heading">Ruby</span>: Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language known for its elegant syntax and simplicity. It emphasizes productivity and is often used in web development frameworks like Ruby on Rails.</p>
        <p><span class="custom-heading">Swift</span>: Swift is a programming language developed by Apple for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS development. It is designed to be safe, fast, and expressive, and is the recommended language for developing applications in the Apple ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p><span class="custom-heading">Rust</span>: Rust is a systems programming language that aims to provide memory safety, concurrency, and performance. It is often used for developing low-level systems, such as operating systems, device drivers, and web servers</p>
        <p><span class="custom-heading">Kotlin</span>: Kotlin is a modern programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is fully interoperable with Java and is widely adopted for Android app development, offering concise syntax and enhanced features.</p>
